# CodeRunnerCLI

I won't be advertising here for [CodeRunner 2](https://coderunnerapp.com), but it's a great app! üòÖ
It's a compromise between bloated IDEs and simple text editors. What's the biggest advantage is that it supports a lot of different programming languages out of the box, so you can jump in and make something useful without fighting with additional dependencies etc. Don't forget it's a native app, so no more struggle with Electron üòú

I was willing to move all my _non serious_ development stuff to Code Runner 2, but I've discovered it lacks a really important feature (at least for me...) - [Command Line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).
If you've been missing it as well and waiting for creators to add it...
Wait no more! It's here and written in nothing else than Swift! üôå

# Requirements

This tool is for **macOS only**. To run it, make sure you have:
+ **Swift 3.1** (SPM)
+ macOS 10.11 or higher

# Installing

To make it work you simply have to

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cojoj/CodeRunnerCLI.git
$ cd CodeRunnerCLI
$ swift build -c release -Xswiftc -static-stdlib
$ cp -f .build/release/CodeRunnerCLI /usr/local/bin/cr
```

Form now on you have a `cr` command line tool available for your user.

# Usage

The most important feature of good code editing tool is possibility to open specific file or directory straight from you command line, because we're all working with `git` and maybe some other tools accessible via terminal. 
**CodeRunnerCLI** allow you to do so without any problem.

If you want to open Code Runner with file named `script.swift`, run:
```bash
$ cr swift.script
```

If you want to open Code Runner in newly created directory, simply run:
```bash
$ cr ~/path/to/some/dir/
```

**CodeRunnerCLI** is able to resolve paths correctly, so you can use things like `~/`, `.` or `..`. We're also taking care of existing files, so if you already have a file with this name in your file system, **CodeRunnerCLI** won't override it, but will just open it for you üòâ
